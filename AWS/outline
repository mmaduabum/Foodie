command overview:

-Follow:
follow [switch_id/name] [time]
	if there are 0 arguments: then do the default switch:
	if the switch_id/name doesn't exist: that's an error
	if the time argument is missing, then we're toggling the one-time flag
	if the time argument is malformed, we assume it's a one-time follow
	if switch_id/name is and valid time is there, set the exp time to current_time() + time
	//someone needs to parse time into a seconds

-Unfollow:
unfollow [switch_id/name]
	if switch_id/name doesn't exist at all:		tell user to fuck off
	if switch_id/name exists but isn't mapped:	you were never there with them
	if switch_id/name exists: remove their subscription (set timestmp and boolean to null)

add [switch_id]
	if switch_id is real: 		add it to the map (with name, and both stamps as null)
	if switch_id isn't real:	return an error message

-Remove:
remove [switch_id/name]
	if switch_id/name is real:		remove the mapping to that user
	if switch_id/name is real,
